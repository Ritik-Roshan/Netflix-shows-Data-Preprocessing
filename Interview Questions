1. What are missing values and how do you handle them?
Ans - Missing values are simply blank spaces in your data — like when someone's name or the date of a movie release isn't recorded.
      We handle them in a few smart ways:

                     Fill them using .fillna() with something like "Unknown", 0, or even the mean/median of a column.
                     Drop them using .dropna() if they’re not essential or are too messy to fix.
                     Impute them statistically (like predicting the value based on other columns).

2. How do you treat duplicate records?
Ans - Duplicate records are like echo entries — the same row showing up more than once.
      Here’s how we handle them:

                     Use .drop_duplicates() to remove them.
                     Sometimes you might group or aggregate instead, depending on context.

3. Difference between .dropna() and .fillna() in Pandas?
Ans - .dropna() = Remove rows (or columns) with missing values.

      .fillna() = Replace missing values with something meaningful.

4. What is outlier treatment and why is it important?
Ans - Outliers are values that are way off the chart — like someone with 1200 years of age in a dataset!

      You treat them by:

                      Removing them if they’re data entry errors.
                      Capping or flooring using IQR or z-scores.
                      Transforming using log/scaling methods.

5. Explain the process of standardizing data.
Ans - Standardization means putting everything on the same scale or format so your analysis doesn’t go haywire.
      
      This includes:
                      Lowercasing column names (First Name → first_name)
                      Date format unification (MM-DD-YYYY → DD-MM-YYYY)
                      Categorical consistency (usa, US, United States → United States)

6. How do you handle inconsistent data formats (e.g., date/time)?
Ans - We handle inconsisten date formats by using:
                      
                      pd.to_datetime() to convert all formats to a standard one.
                      Then use .dt.strftime('%d-%m-%Y') to format it how you like.

7. What are common data cleaning challenges?
Ans - The commond data cleaning challenges include:

                      Missing values in critical fields
                      Inconsistent entries (e.g., typos, different spellings)
                      Duplicates hiding in plain sight
                      Outliers distorting analysis
                      Mixed data types (text where numbers should be!)

8. How can you check data quality?
Ans - Data quality is like food freshness — you check before you consume.
      By using :
                     .info() — for column types and non-null counts
                     .describe() — to look at stats like mean, min, max
                     .isnull().sum() — to find missing values
                     .duplicated().sum() — to count duplicate rows
                     Visual tools like box plots for outliers
